# PomodoroTimer
## Description üïí

A simple Pomodoro clock ‚è∞ used as a method for agile task management. It involves focusing on a task for 15 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break. Here you can see the [project](https://luisandrino.github.io/PomodoroTimer/).

## Goal üéØ

My goal with this project was to create a Pomodoro clock to help me with my procrastination issues. Additionally, I aimed to use simple technologies like HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Screenshots üì∏

Here are two screenshots of the project:

## TODO üìù

- Add CSS effects, such as a circular countdown.
- ~Transform the project into a PWA (Progressive Web Application).~ Thanks to [PWA Builder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) now it is a PWA! ü•≥
- Replace SetIntervals with RequestAnimationFrame. (This because I learned that SetInterval is not precise).

## Roadmap üó∫

- Add stats.
- Add more personalization (ex: choose a theme).


## FAQ ‚ùì

**Why is it so simple?** 
My objective was to make it as lightweight as possible, without using any frameworks that could potentially impact performance.

**How does this Pomodoro differ from others like PomoFocus?** 
In reality, there is no significant difference. In fact, I recommend using PomoFocus. This Pomodoro clock was solely created as a personal project and should not be considered as a fully-fledged product.

**What's next?** 
Next, I plan to rewrite the entire project using a framework like Qwik or even explore using Rust (BTW) with Lepos.
